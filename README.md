**Project 7: Proxy**

A concurrent caching Web proxy that sits between browser and the rest of the World Wide Web. This project exposes students to the interesting world of network programming, and ties together many of the concepts from the course, such as byte ordering, caching, process control, signals, signal handling, file I/O, concurrency, and synchronization.

**Project 6: Malloc**

Implemented own versions of malloc, free, and realloc. This project gives students a clear understanding of data layout and organization, and requires them to evaluate different trade-offs between space and time efficiency.  

**Project 5: Shell**

Implement simple Unix shell program with job control, including the ctrl-c and ctrl-z keystrokes, fg, bg, and jobs commands. This is the first introduction to application level concurrency, and gives students a clear idea of Unix process control, signals, and signal handling.

**Project 4: Cache**

Implemented a general-purpose cache simulator, and then optimized a small matrix transpose kernel to minimize the number of misses on a simulated cache. This project uses the Valgrind tool to generate address traces.

**Project 3: Attack**

Students are given a pair of unique custom-generated x86-64 binary executables, called targets, that have buffer overflow bugs. One target is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The other is vulnerable to return-oriented programming attacks. Students are asked to modify the behavior of the targets by developing exploits based on either code injection or return-oriented programming. This project teaches the students about the stack discipline and teaches them about the danger of writing code that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks

**Project 2: Binary Bomb**

A "binary bomb" is a program provided to students as an object code file. When run, it prompts the user to type in 6 different strings. If any of these is incorrect, the bomb "explodes," printing an error message and logging the event on a grading server. Students must "defuse" their own unique bomb by disassembling and reverse engineering the program to determine what the 6 strings should be. The project teaches students to understand assembly language, and also forces them to learn how to use a debugger.

**Project 1: Data**

Students implement simple logical, two's complement, and floating point functions, but using a highly restricted subset of C. For example, they might be asked to compute the absolute value of a number using only bit-level operations and straightline code. This project helps students understand the bit-level representations of C data types and the bit-level behavior of the operations on data.

**Project 0: C-Programming Review**

The project involves implementing a queue, supporting both last-in, first-out (LIFO) and first-in-first-out (FIFO)
queueing disciplines. The underlying data structure is a singly-linked list, enhanced to make some of the
operations more efficient.
