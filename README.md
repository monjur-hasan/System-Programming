**System-Programming**

**Lab 0: C-Programming Review**

The lab involves implementing a queue, supporting both last-in, first-out (LIFO) and first-in-first-out (FIFO)
queueing disciplines. The underlying data structure is a singly-linked list, enhanced to make some of the
operations more efficient.

Some of the skills tested are:
* Explicit memory management, as required in C.
* Creating and manipulating pointer-based data structures.
* Working with strings.
* Enhancing the performance of key operations by storing redundant information in data structures.
* Implementing robust code that operates correctly with invalid arguments, including NULL pointers.
